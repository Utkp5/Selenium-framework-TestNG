Assertions---here means----validations instead of using if else we use this assertions

Hard assertions
---------------
access though 'Assert' class
all methods are static
if hard assertion got failed then rest of the statement will not be executed.

SoftAssert sa=new SoftAssert();
sa.assertTrue()

if soft assertion got failed then rest of the statemetns still execute.
